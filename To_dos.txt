# *****1. Implement the below steps for the counter first**********8
Multiply x and y with 2000
read counter_gcell_coords.txt for x and y gcell coordinates
use c++ equivalent of the bisect.bisect_left function to get the index of gcell where each pin belongs
club the pins belonging to one gcell as one node
draw the graph
#2. show the graph to me
#3. Run for all the circuits (these are very large with Lakhs of nodes), use gcell_coords.txt file
